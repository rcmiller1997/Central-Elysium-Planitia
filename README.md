# Central-Elysium-Planitia
Radar Classification of Volcanic facies throughout Central Elysium Planitia

**GOAL**

  The goal of this study is to investigate the geomorphological characteristics for the bulk of the Athabasca outflow
system to constrain its geologic evolution. Additionally, we evaluate whether the approximated RMS height and
effective slope (𝛿𝑒 = 𝜎ℎ∕𝑙𝑐 ), derived by coherent and incoherent energies (Grima et al., 2012, 2014), correlates with
lava facies and can be used to infer emplacement processes. These facies and roughness patterns are then linked to
subsurface reflections recorded by SHARAD to test chronostratigraphic hypothesis related to buried lava flows and
constrain flow depths for CEP lavas. 

  To achieve these goals, we identify and describe the morphological properties of the Athabasca Valles lava flow-field based primarily on HiRISE and CTX data, in sparse areas the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS)
mosaics were used where imaging was not available to create a 1:3,000,000-scale facies map, examined at a digitizing
scale of 1:25,000. This map is shown in the issue within the repository. Roughness and spatial
distribution of distinct textures at this scale has yet to be tested with a flood basalt emplacement mode. Ultimately, this
will demonstrate new insights into joint facies and roughness based methods, enhancing our ability to understand lava
flow-field evolution, and advance future investigations of planetary surfaces.
